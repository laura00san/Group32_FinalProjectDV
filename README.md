## WHAT CAN MUSIC TELL ABOUT YOUR MOOD?

Spotify is a Swedish digital music streaming service that allows users to listen any content of their preference, including millions of songs from a wide range of genres and artists, and podcasts. Therefore, in this project we aim to use data from Spotify, one of the bigger key players in the music streaming industry and create a meaningful interactive visualization. 
We decided to analyze music tastes across different decades, what characteristics can be associated with popular songs, as well as the relationship between listener’s mood and the songs.
To do so, we gathered data from Spotify through Kaggle, which comprised songs from 10 decades along with a dataset which included a subset of songs, with an additional variable that allowed to identify users’ mood depending on the song.
